## Implemetaion note
This software uses a customizable base-n number generator to make the magic happen.

## Features to come and things to better
- Is there anything we can do to make it perform better?
- One can think of a html form to address a website and try out some passwords - then this becomes a pentesting software.

## Disclaimer
You may be thinking Â«Oh! U trying to fake a bruteforcer as a permutation generator!Â» but that's completely untrue. It also misses the net part (at the moment). Don't even think about it, you punk. Shame on you. ðŸ˜’
